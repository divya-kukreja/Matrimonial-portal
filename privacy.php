                <b>Profile Design</b>
                <p>Our profile format is designed so as to prevent people from identifying you unless you
                    wish them to do so. Thus the information that is gathered is general in nature -
                    age, height, gender, caste, ethnicity,  occupation, location, family profile, interests,
                    desired partner profile etc. Typically information that will help generate interest
                    among the right prospective life partners without individually identifying you.
                    Uploading photographs is optional.

            <span>B. Protect your confidentiality</span>
            <p class="profile_design">
                <p>At madeinheaven.com we understand that different people have different needs for
                    privacy and confidentiality. Thus For this reason we empower our registrants with
                    tools to customize the privacy levels of their profile, photographs and contacts.
                </p>
                <p>Some of these settings are :
                </p>
                <p>1) For Profile: -  </p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>Allow my detailed profile to be viewed by all visitors or</li>
                    <li>Allow my detailed profile to be viewed only by registered users who pass my filters. </li>
                    <li>Don't show my detailed profile or summary profile to any user, I will search and contact profiles.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Profile visibility settings are available in the settings section which is accessible
                    from the header and footer on all pages after login. We recommend that you go in for the
                    first privacy setting as that will get you the maximum response. Frequently our site is
                    searched by casual browsers who are highly qualified, eligible people or friends and
                    relatives of a prospective bride or groom and thus your profile is visible to this
                    important group of visitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) For Photograph:-
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case you wish to upload your photograph(s) along with your profile then you have the
                    following options : -
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>I want my photos to be visible to all members.</li>
                        <li>I want my photos to be visible only to members I contact and to members I accept.</li>
                    </ol>
                 <p>
                    Thus you get to set that privacy level for your photograph which you feel most
                    comfortable with. We would however recommend that you do upload your photographs
                    and go in for the first privacy setting option as that is likely to get you the maximum
                    relevant response. The photograph privacy settings options are available in the
                    'My Photos' section of the 'My Profile' page. This page can be accessed after you have
                    registered your profile.
